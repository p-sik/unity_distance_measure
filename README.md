# Distance Measuring and Displaying in Unity

Measuring the distance between two clicks and displaying it on a line renderer with text and labels

## TO DO
- change to touch if more functionality needed, otherwise it's okay to keep simulating mouse
- add material to LineRenderer
- change dimensions to work in real scale
